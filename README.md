# FlapPyBird with Parallel Q-Learning

The goal of this project is to parallel train a Reinforement Learning algorithm to play flappy bird. This will be done through techniques discussed in this [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.04296.pdf).

<!-- ## How it works -->

## Usage
`python flappy.py`

## Credits
